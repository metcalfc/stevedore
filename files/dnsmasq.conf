# dnsmasq will listen for DHCP and DNS requests on this interface as

# This option will be forced anyway on OS X so set here to avoid a warning:

# Enable the integrated DHCP server, you need
# to supply the range of addresses available for lease and optionally
# a lease time. If you have more than one network, you will need to
# repeat this for each network on which you want to supply DHCP
# service.
# Select a range from the address and netmask shown in VirtualBox's
# host-only network configuration dialog:

# Set this (and domain: see below) if you want to have a domain
# automatically added to simple names in a hosts-file.
expand-hosts

# Set the domain for dnsmasq. this is optional, but if it is set, it
# does the following things.
# 1) Allows DHCP hosts to have fully qualified domain names, as long
#     as the domain part matches this setting.
# 2) Sets the "domain" DHCP option thereby potentially setting the
#    domain of all systems configured by DHCP
# 3) Provides the domain part for "expand-hosts"
domain=docker.vm

# This must be the address of you host on the vboxnet0 network
# find this in the VirtualBox host-only network preferences
address=/mac.docker.vm/192.168.99.1
